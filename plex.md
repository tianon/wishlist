# [Plex](https://plex.tv/)

- filter my movies out of someone else's collection (so I can choose what to watch that I don't already have)
- "multiple versions" should list the unique filename component ("ArbitraryText"); alternatively some other way to handle "director's cut" or multiple visual languages (eg. japanese text vs english text)
- better handling of multiple episodes in one file (often listed twice, and even sometimes played twice)
- "show info" on mobile
- "fix match" on mobile
- web interface that actually works OK on mobile?
- more permanent custom transcoding settings
- sync watched/unwatched status of the same media between collections / servers
- explicit "watchlist" for tracking things I want to watch
- audiobooks support (essentially audio-only TV shows)
