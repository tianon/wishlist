- per-pocket virtual card (direct Privacy integration?); https://twitter.com/tianon/status/1347445828638543872 + https://twitter.com/bthamilton/status/1347449056683982848
- pocket list sorting
- longer pocket names
- pocket memo/note/description
- button to add money to a pocket after it has activity
- mobile (transaction) notifications (I got a Direct Deposit notification, but it's the first/only I've gotten despite several transfers and many transactions)
- show pockets list faster (currently they all load very slowly and pop in one by one - maybe the pocket amount needs to load separately from the names? the page clearly knows how many there are ahead of time and saves the right amount of space)
- "What should we call you?" (preferred name) separate from legal name
- download statement / transaction log per-pocket
- more obvious per-pocket information (name) in "All Transactions" list
- mail a check (website says "coming"!)
- dark mode
- simple text box to search/filter pockets by name (or by sharing?); everywhere (main dashboard, transfer screen, etc)
- transaction searching/filtering/sorting
- mobile check deposit
- (read-only?) API to list all pockets (inc. deleted?) and their amounts (+ transactions) for record-keeping
- double-click prevention/protection (I made a large transfer, but my buggy mouse double-clicked and I ended up with two and no way to cancel either...)
- the ability to choose to *not* get a contactless/RFID physical card (simple chip+pin preferred)
- "early paycheck" that actually works?  (transactions in Simple posted much earlier, and even pending transactions in Chase show up quicker)
- list special-case "Save" and "Spend" pockets first
- create pocket in one click (instead of explaining what pockets are every time I make one - I've got like 100 of the things now, I think I've got the idea)
- bulk pocket create? (list of names, create them all)
- delayed redirect to pocket after create (with a modal making me think I can exit and do other things before I'm hijacked); either redirect immediately or don't redirect - maybe give me a link instead so I can choose to go to the pocket I just created or not?
- bulk transfer schedule (think "paycheck just dropped; need to allocate bits of it to all the right pockets" - it'd be great to have a way to do several at once instead of one by one)
- sharing pockets without a hanky link I have to send out-of-band (I'd love to add a "friend" who I can then invite to join my pockets without exchanging that link externally where it might get intercepted and have some unexpected joiners)
- custom pocket colors (more means of differentiating pockets quickly)
- drag and drop between pockets to quickly initiate a transfer
