- per-pocket virtual card (direct Privacy integration?); https://twitter.com/tianon/status/1347445828638543872 + https://twitter.com/bthamilton/status/1347449056683982848
- pocket list sorting
- longer pocket names
- pocket memo/note/description
- button to add money to a pocket after it has activity
- mobile (transaction) notifications
- show pockets list faster (currently they all load very slowly and pop in one by one - maybe the pocket amount needs to load separately from the names? the page clearly knows how many there are ahead of time and saves the right amount of space)
- "What should we call you?" (preferred name) separate from legal name
- download statement / transaction log per-pocket
- more obvious per-pocket information (name) in "All Transactions" list
- mail a check (website says "coming"!)
- dark mode
- simple text box to search/filter pockets by name (or by sharing?); everywhere (main dashboard, transfer screen, etc)
- transaction searching/filtering/sorting
- mobile check deposit
- (read-only?) API to list all pockets (inc. deleted?) and their amounts (+ transactions) for record-keeping
- double-click prevention/protection (I made a large transfer, but my buggy mouse double-clicked and I ended up with two and no way to cancel either...)
- the ability to choose to *not* get a contactless/RFID physical card (simple chip+pin preferred)
- "early paycheck" that actually works?  (transactions in Simple posted much earlier, and even pending transactions in Chase show up quicker)
