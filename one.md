"Planned" (https://help.onefinance.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060071534)

- per-pocket virtual card (direct Privacy integration?); https://twitter.com/tianon/status/1347445828638543872 + https://twitter.com/bthamilton/status/1347449056683982848
- mail a check
- mobile check deposit

---

- pocket list sorting (everywhere pockets end up getting listed; alphabetic, amount, asc, desc)
- longer pocket names??
- pocket memo/note/description
- button to add money to a pocket (from the pocket details screen) even after it has activity
- mobile (transaction) notifications (I got a Direct Deposit notification, but it's the first/only I've gotten despite several transfers and many transactions)
- show pockets list faster (currently they all load very slowly and pop in one by one - maybe the pocket amount needs to load separately from the names? the page clearly knows how many there are ahead of time and saves the right amount of space)
- "What should we call you?" (preferred name) separate from legal name
- download statement / transaction log per-pocket (CSV would be great, PDF would be fine)
- more obvious per-pocket information (name) in "All Transactions" list
- dark mode
- simple text box to search/filter pockets by name (or by amount, who it's shared with, etc would be even nicer); everywhere (main dashboard, transfer screen, etc)
- transaction searching/filtering/sorting (in all and in per-pocket)
- (read-only?) API to list all pockets (inc. deleted?) and their amounts (+ transactions) for record-keeping / auditing
- double-click prevention/protection (I made a large transfer, but my buggy mouse double-clicked the final confirmation button and I ended up with two pending transfers and no way to cancel either...)
- the ability to choose to *not* get a contactless/RFID physical card (simple chip+pin preferred forever)
- "early paycheck" that actually works?  (transactions in Simple posted much earlier, and even pending transactions in Chase show up quicker, and I'm confused)
- list special-case "Save" and "Spend" pockets first consistently (transfer screen, etc)
- create pocket in one click (instead of explaining what pockets are every time I make one - I've got like 100 of the things now, I think I've got the idea)
- bulk pocket create? (list of names, create them all)
- remove buggy delayed redirect to pocket after create (with a modal making me think I can exit and do other things before I'm hijacked); either redirect immediately or don't redirect - maybe give me a link instead so I can choose to go to the pocket I just created or not?
- bulk transfer (think "paycheck just dropped; need to allocate bits of it to all the right pockets" - it'd be great to have a way to do several at once instead of one by one)
- sharing pockets without a hanky link I have to send out-of-band (I'd love to add a "friend" who I can then invite to join my pockets without exchanging that link externally where it might get intercepted and have some unexpected joiners)
- some way to share money with someone without sharing a pocket they have to then take it out of (perhaps a pocket that is my default "receive money" pocket similar to my "spend from" pocket which then my friends can send money in one direction to without having a weird shared pocket that they have to then transfer the money out of)
- custom pocket colors (more means of differentiating pockets quickly)
- drag and drop between pockets to quickly initiate a transfer

- (optionally?) combine to/from transactions in the "All Transactions" list ("$xx transferred from FOO to BAR" instead of two split transactions)
- JSON format download of transaction history (much easier to sort through programmatically at Tax Time)
- ability to split the "save", "auto-save", and "spend" special pockets into sub-categories/pockets for organization
- pocket groups/folders/categories would be really useful with lots
- (update on faster transactions above) is it perhaps that One does not yet support "Same-Day ACH" and that it might come soon?  if that's the case, then what is "Early Paycheck" and why is it different?
