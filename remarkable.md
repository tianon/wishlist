# reMarkable (Paper Pro)

I recently ~~bought~~ acquired (work reimbursement) a reMarkable Paper Pro.  So far, the experience leaves quite a bit to be desired (or in product speak, "room for growth")!

Instead of wallowing in buyer's remorse, I'm typing out my thoughts here.

## notes

- enabling "developer mode" requires a factory reset (that seems unnecessarily excessive?  but I guess?)

- developer mode information lives in ... copyright and licenses? 🤔

- settings are really sparse; maybe that's a good thing?  it feels weird after how expensive this thing was

## software wishlist

- dark mode

- charging indicator / battery level / estimated charge time, especially while "sleeping"
  - an "always-on" charge level indicator would be so nice
  - (especially if it could be a button for the "quick settings" that I cannot seem to reliably engage)
- a direct button into "full" settings from the quick settings

- the ability to use my "Type Folio" case keyboard to type text on PDFs
  - without this, what's the point of even *having* the keyboard case?

- a way to copy files (PDF, ePub, etc) via `scp` such that they show up in the interface
  - ie, "what's up with `.local/share/remarkable/xochitl` and why is it so esoteric?"

- if a PDF has explicit "text" fields, etc, they should be interactive (not ignored)

- enabling Google Drive gives you a way to "import" from Drive and "export" back to Drive, but that's a horrible experience that's totally counter to the way Drive works
  - something more like bi-directional sync would make this actually useful instead of a substance-less checkbox on a features list

- optional PIN (or an optional time-based lock instead of just "it closed, lock it up")
  - typing a PIN every time I need to write a note is a PITA that makes me not want to use the device at all
  - perhaps adding a way to write notes directly on the lock screen would help?  and they get dumped into a special document or something?  (obviously write-only, like how most phones will let you take pictures without unlocking but you can only view what you've just taken)

- if I've scribbled something with the pen and later select it, I should be able to change at least the color (not just size/position)
  - it would be nice to *also* be able to change the tool type or stroke width (pencil to pen to marker to thick marker, etc)

- better ways to preview colors, strokes, etc on the current document than just drawing something and then erasing it
  - maybe a way to expand the "tool" drawer into a full document overlay with sample strokes/colors and the option to select one?
  - this is especially important for PDFs with background colors, because those make all the pen colors even funkier

- an explicit "plain text" document type that doesn't support scribbles, especially for easier exporting

- "vi-compatible" mode for editing text (especially "plain text" suggested above)

- snap to grid when using a grid template
- (optionally) snap to "straight" or 45 degree clicks when moving, rotating, resizing, especially "straight" shapes like squares

- more tools for drawing shapes, especially straight lines
  - the "draw the best you can then hold your pen" is a cute party trick, but it would be way nicer to have the line draw straight to begin with instead

- some way to swap colors faster (configurable toolbar? optional second toolbar? lots of dead/unused space on this enormous screen)

- simpler bookmarks / ways to flip back and forth between pages
  - I have a PDF that starts with a "study plan" of references I need to go back to all the time and it's a big pain to flop back and forth between the page I'm currently reading and that study plan

- applications, especially for content that's accessed in more dynamic ways than a PDF tends to be (reference manuals, church hymnals, etc)

- more visual feedback during gestures (there's a delay between every gesture and it doing literally anything and every single time I wonder if I've even done the gesture correctly)

## hardware wishlist

- fingerprint scanner (see also note above about optional PIN)

- more vibrant colors?  there's only 6 *actual* colors above black/gray(/white), and they're all so muted that it feels like there's only 3

- a better *carrying* case (this thing is massive and I need something like a full on purse just to carry it around with me)
