# [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)

- ~~sync on Linux! (even behind a feature flag)~~

---

- put tabs to "sleep" manually (task manager?)
- "open" a collection and have it stay in-sync with the open window (esp. on two machines at once)
- some way to explicitly wake up tabs instead of implicitly (I often wake up tabs while clicking through windows trying to find the one I'm looking for)
- some indication in the task manager of sleeping tabs (bonus points for showing the resource savings by having the tab be asleep)
- some way to disable auto-update / auto-restart attempts (neither of which will *ever* work properly for the way I use Edge, and are extremely disruptive)
- a setting to open things like "what's new" in a new window instead of a new tab in a random window on browser startup (also links from external applications)
- use "BETA" / "DEV" version of the icon (shown on "About" page) for window icons so they're easy to differentiate when running multiple channels at the same time
- ability to force a tab's "full screen" to be full screen within the tab instead of real full screen (exactly how it works when casting a tab, in fact)
- ability to cast a window (instead of "full desktop" or "single tab")
- ability to cast a tab "na√Øvely" while ignoring any "cast" behavior the tab might have
